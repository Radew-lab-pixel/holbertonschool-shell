Task 23 : Write a command that finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and all sub-directories.

    Only the names of the files and directories should be displayed (not the entire path)
    Hidden files should be listed
    One file name per line
    The listing should end with a new line
    You are not allowed to use basename, grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep

 Answer  - > find . -empty |rev | cut -d "/" -f1 |rev 

NOT find .* -size 0 | rev | cut -d "/" -f1 | rev

NOT find .* -size 0 
NOT find .* -size 0 | rev | cut -d "/" -f1 | rev | sort -u
NOt ls -alR | cut -s -f3,9 -d " "   
NOT find .* -empty |  tr -s "/" | cut -f3 -d "/"
NOT find .* -empty | uniq -u |  tr -s "/" | cut -f3 -d "/"
NOT find .* -print -empty | uniq -u |  tr -s "/" | cut -f3 -d "/"
 NOT  find *. -empty | uniq -u  
NOT find *. -empty
NOT 		find empty 

Task 24 : Write a script that lists all the files with a .gif extension in the current directory and all its sub-directories.

    Hidden files should be listed
    Only regular files (not directories) should be listed
    The names of the files should be displayed without their extensions
    The files should be sorted by byte values, but case-insensitive (file aaa should be listed before file bbb, file .b should be listed before file a, and file Rona should be listed after file jay)
    One file name per line
    The listing should end with a new line
    You are not allowed to use basename, grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep


  Answer :  
find . -type f -name "*.gif" | rev | cut -f1 -d "/" | rev | cut -f1 -d "."  |LC_ALL=C sort
 NOTfind . -type f -name "*.gif" | rev | cut -f1 -d "/" | rev | cut -f1 -d "."  |sort --numeric-sort
NOT find .* -type f -name "*.md" | rev | cut -f1 -d "/" | rev | cut -f1 -d "." 
NOT find . -type f -name "*.md" | rev | cut -f1 -d "/" | rev | cut -f1 -d "." 
NOT find . -type f -name "*.md" | rev | cut -f1 -d "/" | rev | cut -f1 -d "."
